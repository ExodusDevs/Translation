# TranslationAPI
A translation library for your code from PocketMine-MP 4.0.0 or earlier
## How to use it?
First you initialize the class, then use its methods
```php
//$this = PluginBase class
$translation = new Translation($this);
```
First choose the default language to use if that language does not exist
```php
//i will use the language of the USA
$translation->setDefaultLanguage("en_US");
```
after this... soon
